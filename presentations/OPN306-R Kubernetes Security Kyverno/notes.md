# Start
## What is Kyverno
* A policy engine for kubernetes, policies as kubernetes  resources. No new languages needed.
* Resource management: validate, mutate, generate, or cleanup resources.
* Security: Verify container images and inspect metadata
* Resource matching: use label selectors and wildcards
* overlays for validation and mutation(like kustomize)
* config syncronization across namespaces
* admission controls block non-conformant resources.
* policy violations reporting: report instead of blocking
* use kyverno CLI in CI/CD pipelines

## Validation
This process categorized resources into two distinct outcomes: compliant resources receive approval and proceed unhindered, while non-compliant resources face rejection.

## Mutation
Mutation empowers kyverno to dynamically alter resources before their admission to the cluster. This powerful feature allows for automatic modifications, enhancing resource configurations on the fly.

## Generation
Kyverno empowers users to dynamically create new kubernetes resources by leveraging definitions embedded within policies

## Kyverno Installation
[Kyverno Installation](https://kyverno.io/docs/installation/)

Helm is the preferred installation method
### Standalone Installation Method
``` bash
helm repo add kyverno https://kyverno.github.io/kyverno/
helm repo update
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno -n kyverno --create-namespace
```

### High Availability Installation
``` bash
helm install kyverno kyverno/kyverno -n kyverno --create-namespace \
--set admissionController.replicas=3 \
--set backgroundController.replicas=2 \
--set cleanupController.replicas=2 \
--set reportsController.replicas=2
```

### Pod Standard Security Policies

``` bash
helm install kyverno-policies kyverno/kyverno-policies -n kyverno
```
